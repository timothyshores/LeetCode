# Stack

Uses the last in first out principal. Real world examples include a can of Pringles potato chips.The last potato chip that was added into the can at the top of the stack is the first potato chip that you'd remove from the top if you're only able to a single chip from the top of the can. 

If you were full and wanted to put the potato chip that's current in your hand back into the can you'd have to add it back to the top of the can. 

This is basically the same thing as a stack data structure. You're only allowed to access and remove the top element from the stack.

Stacks are used within compilers as in the call stack in recursive functions, they're used in browsers in order for the functionality to move backwards and forwards.

Stacks can be implemented using either an built using an array or a Linked List.
