// Create a helper queue
// Add the root to the queue
// Start a loop that keeps going until the queue is empty
// Dequeue the front head node from the queue
// Push the value of that node into our final return array
// If there's a left properly on the node that was just dequeued then add it to the queue
// If there's a right properly on the node that was just dequeued then add it to the queue
// Return the final array
